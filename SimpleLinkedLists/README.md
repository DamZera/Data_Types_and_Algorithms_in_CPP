# Implementation of simple linked-list in C++ 
The SimpleLinkedList.h file contains all the basic operations perfermable on a simple linked list (add, add_last, pop, pop_last, ...). They are implemented in the SimpleLinkedList.cpp file.

All these functions are already implemented in C++, so I do this just to understand what's underneath and for fun ;)

## How to use it in your program ?

To use it in a program, you have to include the "SimpleLinkedList.cpp" file (yes the .cpp because I have a template)

Let's assume that your test file is called "Main.cpp"

You'll just have to compile it (as if there wasn't any other file) :

g++ -o test Main.cpp
